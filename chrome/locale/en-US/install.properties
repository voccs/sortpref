# This file is not included in official releases; it provides a place for
# translators to add translations for the install.rdf description as well

# Please consider this OPTIONAL.

install.description=Adds the ability to control primary, default sorting and threading options.
# amo.summary is the same as install.description
amo.description=Provides settings to control which order messages are sorted initially and by which field as well as whether to display in threaded mode.  Please note this data ends up stored in each folder, so changing control values only affect new folders or those with a rebuilt index.  The mechanics are described in https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=86845 - this extension merely adds gloss to somebody else's actual code.
amo.developer_comments=This does not affect parts of Thunderbird outside of mail.  There are no feature plans other than maintaining compatibility as Thunderbird continues to improve. SortPref is not available for earlier versions of Thunderbird as the fixes that enable it were added during Thunderbird 3 releases.
amo.release_notes=This release incorporates options for viewing as threaded.  Please report any bugs or feature requests.
